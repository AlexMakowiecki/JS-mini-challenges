# JS Mini projects
## Details
Mini-challenges, part of the end of Module 5, and each one covers a single topic

- **Challenge 1:** destructuring to manage object properties more easily
- **Challenge 2 & 3:** array.map() to create arrays using data of other, and array.join() to convert an array to string
- **Challenge 4:** array.reduce() to reduce an array to a single value using the data inside the array
- a **Superchallenge** to practice the topics above 
- **Challenge 5:** rest parameter to put an unknown quantity of arguments into an array
- **Challenge 6:** spread syntax to use all of the items of an array, but without being inside that array
- **Challenge 7 & 8:** OR shortcircuit, to assign a second value in case the first doesn't exist; AND shortcircuit to make a shorter if logic
- **Challenge 9 & 10:** the constructor syntax to create the outline of an object, making it possible to create the same type of object multiple times

I also created a website that showcases all of the challenges on one single page, using Iframes
